SOFTWARE REQUIRMENT
The software requirements explain the software components that we need to develop our project. It is selected such a way that it reduces our work and easy to implement the project anywhere.
WINDOWS OS (8/7/XP / 2000 / 2000 Server / 2003 Server)
python idle 
Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.
cv2
  OpenCV-Python is a library of Python bindings designed to solve computer vision problems. cv2. imread() method loads an image from the specified file. If the image cannot be read (because of missing file, improper permissions, unsupported or invalid format) then this method returns an empty matrix.
numpy 
  NumPy is a Python package which stands for 'Numerical Python'. It is the core library for scientific computing, which contains a powerful n-dimensional array object, provide tools for integrating C, C++ etc. It is also useful in linear algebra, random number

HARDWARE SPECIFICATION


The decision to acquire computer hardware or software must be handled in the same way as any other business decision. The variety of sizes and Types of computing resources available puts a burden on the analyst who must select suitable hardware, software or services and advice the top management accordingly.

Today, selecting a system is a serious and time-consuming business. The time spent on the selection process is a function of the application and whether the system is a basic microcomputer or a mainframe. In either case, planning system selection and acquiring experienced help were necessary payoff in the long run.

The selection process should be viewed as a project and a project team should be formed with the help of management.


Hardware Specification for Development, Implementation

Minimum Requirements:

P-IV 2.8 GHz Processor and Above

RAM 512MB and Above

HDD 20 GB Hard Disk Space and Above



FEASIBILITY

Operational feasibility
Technical Feasibility
Economical Feasibility

A. Operational Feasibility



Proposed projects are beneficial only if they can be turned into information systems that will meet the organizations operating requirements. Simply stated, the test of feasibility asks if the system will work when it is developed and installed. Are there any major barriers to implementations? Is there sufficient support for the project from the management? Are current business methods acceptable to the users? Have the users been involved in the planning and development of the project? Will the proposed system cause any harm? 

The purpose of the operational feasibility study is to determine whether the new system will be used if it is developed and installed and whether there will be resistance from users that will be resistance from users that will undermine the possible application benefit.
There was no difficulty in implemented the software and proposed system is so effective, user friendly, functionally reliable so that the users in the company will find that the new system reduces the hard steps.

B. Technical feasibility


A study of function, performances and constraints and improve the ability to create an acceptable system. Technical feasibility is frequently the most difficult area to achieve at the stage of product engineering process. Considering that are normally associated with the technical feasibility includes
Development risk
Resource availability Technology
Technical feasibility study deals with the hardware as well as the software requirements. The scope was whether the work for the project is done with the current requirements and the existing software technology has to be examined in the feasibility study. The outcome was found to be positive.

C. Economic feasibility


The cost evaluation is weighted against ultimate income or benefit derived from the developed system or project. Economic justification is generally the "Button line" consideration that includes cost benefit analysis, long term corporate income strategies, impact on other profit centers or products, cost of resources needed for development and potential market growth. When compared to the advantage obtained from implementing the system its cost is affordable. Also the system is designed to meet the modification required in the future. Therefore most of the modifications can be done without much re-work.

for the speak recognization 

arsed_results = result.get("ParsedResults")[0]
text_detected = parsed_results.get("ParsedText")
print(text_detected)
engine =pyttsx3.init('sapi5')
voices=engine.getProperty('voices')
engine.setProperty('voice',voices[0].id)
 


for storing the file into the os thier are usen 
file handling 


data=this()
	print(data)
	data=data[0]
	print(data)
	data=int(data)
	data=data+1
	data=str(data)
	print(data)
	a1=open("this.txt",'w')
	a1.write(data)
	a1.close()
	a=open(data,'w')
	a.write(text_detected1)
	a.close()
